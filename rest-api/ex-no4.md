#Lombok
###I like lombok
Lombok is great library that saves  developers time. When I firstly discovered it, I started using it on every new project I did. 
I like to use Lombok for several reasons, the most important plus of using Lombok is avoiding boilerplate code, especially when it comes to dto or pojo classes, Lombok simply generates needed methods instead of writing them everytime. 
Another reason is that, when you are using lombok your code becomes cleaner and easier to read, because it hides boilerplate code. 
Almost every company which uses lombok, uses it because lombok is opensource library. Lombok has been released a long time ago, in 2009. During 13 years it gained a big popularity and stable name.

###I dislike lombok
I find one disadvantage in using Lombok, when you decide to use Lombok in project, everyone in team will use it too. Also you need to import additional dependencies to project when Records is jdks built-in feature
It is difficult to debug Lombok code, it is possible to debug code only by delomboking the code first

##Comparing with java records
Java records has same features with Lombok like Getter, All args, to string, equals and hash code, but implementation is different, while Records are a semantic feature, the Lombok is about syntax.
Java records are useful for functional programming while Lombok can be used anywhere else. Java records were firstly released in jdk 14, it replaces Lombok features. I think java records are not yet stable and i would rather use Lombok features in production rather than records, because Lombok provides a lot more useful features in comparison with Records.
